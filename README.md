In this learning we're using python `3.14.2`

## Print Statement

For print somethings we can use `print()` function, which is an in-built function in python. No semicolon needed at the end.

```python
print("Be Happy!")
```

## Variables & Data Types

As we know `Variables` are basically a container to store and maintain a data and the `Data Types` are the type of the data stored.

![Data Types](https://datascientest.com/en/files/2024/06/Python-Variables-1024x585.jpg)

Data Types:

- **`int`** – Represents integer numbers, used for counting and performing arithmetic.

- **`float`** – Represents floating-point numbers (decimals), used for precise calculations.

- **`complex`** – Represents complex numbers, used for mathematical computations involving real and imaginary parts.

- **`str`** – Represents text (string of characters), used for storing and manipulating text.

- **`list`** – Ordered, mutable collection, used for storing sequences of items.

- **`tuple`** – Ordered, immutable collection, used for storing fixed sequences of items.

- **`range`** – Represents a sequence of numbers, used in looping and generating ranges of numbers.

- **`set`** – Unordered, mutable collection of unique items, used for fast membership tests and eliminating duplicates.

- **`frozenset`** – Immutable set, used for immutable collections of unique items.

- **`dict`** – Unordered collection of key-value pairs, used for mapping relationships between data.

- **`bool`** – Represents truth values `True` and `False`, used for conditional statements and logical operations.

- **`bytes`** – Immutable sequence of bytes, used for binary data.

- **`bytearray`** – Mutable sequence of bytes, used for handling binary data that needs modification.

- **`memoryview`** – A view object for binary data, used to manipulate slices of large binary data without copying.

- **`None`** – Represents the absence of a value, used to signify "nothing" or a missing value.
